"""
You are encouraged to build your own step function according to your needs.
Two steps that you see bellow are:
    * General step that just compares and asserts the result.
    * General step that just compares and clicks on the found result.

What is needed for image match:
    * You need to capture an image in which we look for the element you want to find.
        * Provided by capture_image method in Matcher class.
        * This option is True by default.
        * If you have your own, set capture=False and provide self.screen_path in the Matcher class.

    * You need to match the two images, you are looking for a 'needle'.
      So you provide it in function or in step call (.feature file).
        * Provided by match which will return True or False. Lets user react on False return value.
        * Provided by assert_match which will assert the result and terminate the test on False.

    * (Optional) You can draw the result for attachment or your own confirmation that matching works.
        * Provided by draw method on Matcher instance to get an image with highlighted needle.
          Highlight is a red rectangle exactly in a place of a match, surrounding provided needle.

    * (Optional) You can click on your found result.
        * Provided by click method in Matcher instance.
        * Requirements are of course success of a match/assert_match.

    * (Optional) You can embed result to test report.
        * For this option the method draw is required.
        * Use method provided in TestSandbox class: attach_image_to_report(context, image=image_location, caption="DefaultCaption")
        * Or embed it on your own: context.embed("image/png", open(image_location, "rb").read(), caption="DefaultCaption")
        * Remember that result is saved in Matcher instance as self.diff_path which equals "/tmp/diff.png"
